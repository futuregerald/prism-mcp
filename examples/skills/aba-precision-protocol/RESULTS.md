---

## Incident 1: VS Code Regex Crash

### Before (No Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Goal statement** | "Fix the extension" ← vague |
| **Observable?** | ❌ No — "fix" is not measurable |
| **Steps taken** | 6 changes batched in one commit |
| **Verification per step** | ❌ None — "it compiled = it works" |
| **Error caught at** | User report (2 sessions later) |
| **Root cause found** | After 3 attempts over 2 sessions |
| **Prompts required** | 4 |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🔴 HIGH — "it compiles" pattern reinforced |

### After (With Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Goal statement** | "The webview must NOT throw SyntaxError when evaluating the getMarkdownScript array" ← observable |
| **Observable?** | ✅ Yes — testable with `node -e "eval(...)"` |
| **Steps taken** | 1 function at a time |
| **Verification per step** | ✅ `eval()` test after each change |
| **Error caught at** | Same step — eval test fails immediately |
| **Root cause found** | First attempt |
| **Prompts required** | 1 |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🟢 NONE |

> **Rule applied**: Rule 2 (slow/precise) + Rule 1 (observable goal)

## Incident 2: AI False Capability Denial

### Before (No Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Goal statement** | None stated — user showed screenshot |
| **Observable?** | N/A — agent didn't form a goal |
| **Agent response** | "Want me to adjust the prompt?" |
| **Correct response** | Investigate → Fix immediately |
| **Prompts required** | 2 (user had to say "is it a bug?") |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🟡 LOW — wrong pattern appeared once |

### After (With Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Goal statement** | "When user asks 'do you have GitHub access?', AI must respond with YES and mention git_tool" |
| **Observable?** | ✅ Yes — send the query, check the response |
| **Agent response** | Investigate route.ts line 920 → Find hardcoded wrong example → Fix |
| **Prompts required** | 0 (agent acts on first observation) |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🟢 NONE |

> **Rule applied**: Rule 3 (mistakes become behaviors) + fix-without-asking skill

---

## Incident 3: Split-Brain False Warning

### Before (No Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **User prompt** | "it's a huge bug" |
| **Agent response** | "This isn't a code bug — it's expected behavior. No fix needed." |
| **Code lines read** | 0 (agent guessed from output text) |
| **Prompts to fix** | 3 (user had to say it 3 times) |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🔴 CRITICAL — dismiss pattern reinforced 2× before correction |

```
Prompt 1: "it's a huge bug"           → Agent: "expected behavior"  ❌
Prompt 2: "you said code is affected" → Agent: "no build needed"    ❌
Prompt 3: "make a new prism build"    → Agent: finally investigates ✅
```

### After (With Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **User prompt** | "it's a huge bug" |
| **Agent response** | [reads ledgerHandlers.ts:685-710] → "Found it — the condition uses `!==` but should use `>`. Fixed." |
| **Code lines read** | 25 (the actual split-brain detection block) |
| **Prompts to fix** | 1 |
| **Reinforcement risk** | 🟢 NONE |

> **Rule applied**: Rule 3 (stop-fix-verify) + Rule 2 (read code before forming opinion)

## Incident 4: Vercel Deploy Failures

### Before (No Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Verification after push** | ❌ None — assumed it would work |
| **Who caught the error** | User (multiple times) |
| **Agent response** | "All deploys are READY" (checked old deploys, not new) |
| **Prompts required** | 3+ across sessions |

### After (With Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Verification after push** | ✅ Wait 30s → Check latest deploy via API → Confirm READY |
| **Who catches the error** | Agent (automated verification in CI skill) |
| **Prompts required** | 0 (agent verifies proactively) |

> **Rule applied**: Rule 2 (verify each step before proceeding)

## Incident 5: highlightImportant Regex (Second Crash)

### Before (No Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **First fix attempt** | Fixed `highlightSyntax` only |
| **Verification scope** | Only tested the function changed |
| **Second crash found by** | User (same error, different function) |
| **Root cause** | `/(/` in `highlightImportant` — same class of bug, different location |

### After (With Protocol)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **First fix attempt** | Scan ENTIRE bundled output for `/(/` pattern |
| **Verification scope** | Full `eval()` of all script functions |
| **Second crash found by** | Agent (automated regex scan) |
| **Prompts required** | 0 |

> **Rule applied**: Rule 1 (goal = "NO `/(` anywhere in compiled output" — measurable) + Rule 2 (verify comprehensively)

## Test Suite Coverage

All 3 rules are encoded as executable Vitest tests in [v43-aba-precision.test.ts](file:///Users/admin/prism/tests/v43-aba-precision.test.ts):

| Rule | Tests | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Rule 1: Observable Goals | 13 (6 vague rejections, 6 observable accepts, 1 IOA) | ✅ 13/13 |
| Rule 2: Slow/Precise Execution | 4 (complete, stop-at-2, stop-at-1, never-skip) | ✅ 4/4 |
| Rule 3: Intermittent Reinforcement | 6 (none, low, high, critical, regression, correct) | ✅ 6/6 |
| Integration | 1 (full protocol pipeline) | ✅ 1/1 |
| **Total** | **24** | **✅ 24/24** |

---

## Conclusion

The ABA Precision Protocol addresses the root cause of agent behavioral failures: **uncaught errors create intermittent reinforcement schedules that strengthen wrong patterns**. 

By requiring observable goals, step-by-step verification, and immediate error correction, the protocol eliminates the reinforcement loop before it starts. The test suite provides regression coverage so these patterns can't silently return.
